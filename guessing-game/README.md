# 🎯 Guessing Game (Beginner Python Project)

Welcome to the **Guessing Game**, a beginner-friendly Python project where the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100 in 7 attempts.

This is a great practice for:
- Working with loops and conditionals
- Using random number generation
- Handling user input and exceptions

---

## 📌 How It Works

- The computer selects a random number from 1 to 100.
- You have 7 tries to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, you'll be told whether your guess is too high or too low.
- If you guess the number, you win. If you use all your attempts, the game ends.

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your machine  
  You can check with:

```bash
python --version
```

## 🛠️ How to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository (or fork if you haven't yet):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_Project.git
cd Python_Project/guessing-game
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
python guessing-game.py
```

You’ll play the game directly in the terminal.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
`random.randint()`

`input()` and type casting

`try/except` for error handling

`while` loop and basic logic flow

## 🧩 Example Output

```bash
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
You have 7 attempts to guess it correctly.

Enter your guess: 50
Too low. Try a higher number.
Attempts left: 6

Enter your guess: 75
Too high. Try a lower number.
Attempts left: 5
...
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number!
```
