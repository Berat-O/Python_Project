# Temperature Conversion using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple neural network implemented with TensorFlow to convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit.

# Considerations for .py vs .ipynb Versions

This repository provides two versions of the project implementation: .py and .ipynb. Each version offers distinct advantages depending on your preference and use case:
Python Script (.py)

    Execution: The .py script is straightforward to execute in any Python environment. It runs as a standalone application and is ideal for integrating into automated workflows or scripts.

    Portability: It can be easily shared and run on any system with Python installed, making it suitable for deployment in various environments without dependencies on specific tools.

    Version Control: Tracks changes efficiently using version control systems like Git, making collaboration and project management seamless.

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

    Interactive Exploration: The .ipynb notebook provides an interactive environment where you can execute code cells individually, visualize outputs inline, and annotate with markdown.

    Educational Use: It serves as an excellent tool for teaching and learning, allowing users to experiment with code snippets, visualize data, and understand the project flow interactively.

    Documentation: Offers a narrative structure that combines code, visualizations, and explanations, making it easier to understand and reproduce results.

# Choosing the Right Version

    For Development: Use the .py script for streamlined development, automation, and integration into larger projects or pipelines.

    For Exploration and Education: Opt for the .ipynb notebook to explore the project interactively, visualize outputs, and document your experiments and findings effectively.

Choose the version that best fits your needs and enjoy exploring the capabilities of TensorFlow in temperature conversion!
